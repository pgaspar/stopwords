h1. STOPWORDS

h2. REALLY JUST A LIST OF STOPWORDS WITH SOME HELPERS

Obviously part of something bigger but worth breaking out for reuse. 

h2. THIS FORK

This fork replaces the original 250 stopwords with 429 from the "Onix Text Retrieval Toolkit":http://www.lextek.com/manuals/onix/stopwords1.html.

Some deprecation errors were also fixed.

h2. USAGE

<pre><code>
	
require 'stopwords'

#List all stop words
Stopwords::STOP_WORDS

#Test to see if a token is a stop word
Stopwords.is?('and')

=>true

#Ensures a token is both a 'word' and not a stop word
Stopwords.valid?('vector')

=>true

</code></pre>

h2. SPECS

<pre><code>
$ rake specs
</code></pre>

h2. SANITIZE

Not part of the library but you should probably sanitize tokens before using them (if your tokenize doesn't already)

<pre><code>
SANITIZE_REGEXP = /('|\"|‘|’|\/|\\)/
text.downcase.gsub(SANITIZE_REGEXP, '')
</code></pre>
